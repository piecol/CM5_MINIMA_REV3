# CM5 MINIMA REV3

## Introduction

The **CM5 MINIMA REV2** is a compact carrier board for the latest Raspberry Pi computing module 5.
It is designed for embedded applications, DIY electronics, and low-power computing projects. Unlike traditional desktop computers, the CM5 is a small, efficient system that integrates essential computing hardware onto a single board. Whether you're a hobbyist, developer, or engineer, this module provides a versatile platform for various applications, including IoT, automation, and custom hardware development.

If you're not familiar with Raspberry Pi or single-board computers (SBCs), think of the CM5 as a miniaturized computer that can handle tasks like data processing, networking, and hardware control, all while fitting in the palm of your hand.

## Getting Started

To use the **CM5 MINIMA REV3**, you'll need:

- A **USB-C power adapter** that supports Power Delivery (PD).
- A **display (HDMI)** and **input devices (USB keyboard/mouse)** for setup.
- A **network connection** (Ethernet or Wi-Fi via an external adapter if needed).

## Flashing OS

To flash an operating system (OS) to the CM5, use the switch located on the bottom of the board to enable flashing mode. It is equivalent to the "Fit nRPI_BOOT to J2 (disable eMMC Boot) on the IO board jumper." on the CM5 IO board.
